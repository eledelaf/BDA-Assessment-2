---- Part 1: Audio Download Pipeline and Logging ----
#Â Step 3: 
1. Which one is faster?
    After running the parallel version and the serial version we can conclude that; 
    the parallel version is much quiker. The time it took for the parallel version to 
    download all of the videos was 3.8 seconds while the serial version took around 23 seconds 
    and running a parallel programming with a semaphore with n=5 max number of processes 
    happening at the time tooks about 6 seconds.
2. What are the trade-offs?
    On one hand seriall programming is easier to code, and easier to understnad. Since the code goes 
    one by one in each of the processes we avoid some problems like overlapping the CPU 
    or other possible problems that can come by downloading multiple files at the same time.
    On the other hand parallel programming is faster and with working with big amounts of data is more useful.
    The problems are that is more complicated to code and to understand, we do not know the order in wich the 
    downloads are completed so in case of error that could be a problem. 
3. How do time complexity and space complexity change?
    Serial:
    - Time complexity: O(n)
    - Space complexity: O(1)

    Parallel without semaphore:
    - Time complexity: O(1)
    - Space complexity: O(n)

    Parallel with semaphore:
    - Time complexity: O(n/5)
    - Space complexity: O(5)
