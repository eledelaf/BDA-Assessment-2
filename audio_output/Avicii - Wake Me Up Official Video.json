  "description": "”It’s so far away from anything I’ve ever done before musically, so it’s obviously a weight off my shoulders that everything went the way it did” — Tim ’Avicii’ Bergling.\n \nJune 17th 2023 marks one decade since the release of Wake Me Up – a song that came to change EDM music forever. As a key part of the album True, Wake Me Up was one of the songs where Avicii showed the world his ability to blend different genres — transcending the boundaries of ages, music preferences, and cultures worldwide.\n\nIn loving memory of Tim Bergling (1989-2018).\n\nListen to more music by Avicii here: https://Avicii.lnk.to/Channel\nIn Dolby Atmos: https://avicii.lnk.to/SpatialAudio\n\nFeeling my way through the darkness\nGuided by a beating heart\nI can't tell where the journey will end\nBut I know where to start\nThey tell me I'm too young to understand\nThey say I'm caught up in a dream\nWell life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes\nWell that's fine by me\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself, and I\nDidn't know I was lost\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself, and I\nDidn't know I was lost\nI tried carrying the weight of the world\nBut I only have two hands\nHope I get the chance to travel the world\nBut I don't have any plans\nWish that I could stay forever this young\nNot afraid to close my eyes\nLife's a game made for everyone\nAnd love is a prize\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself, and I\nDidn't know I was lost\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself, and I\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know\n\n#Avicii #WakeMeUp",
